# HTML: It's so great, the inventor was knighted.

*HyperText Markup Language*, or **HTML**, is internet Lego. It's the basic building blocks used to create a website; it's purely ***markup***, "tags that [...] provide additional information about the text" ([Linux Information Project](http://www.linfo.org/markup_language.html)). With HTML, we can break content and concepts into distinct chunks of markup, and then do things to them later with technologies like *Cascading Style Sheets* and *JavaScript*. 

HTML was first proposed [in 1990](http://www.w3.org/Proposal.html) by Tim Berners-Lee, and was officially published in 1995 as HTML 2.0, which sounded more trustworthy or something. Since then, HTML has gone through a handful of changes â€“ HTML5 is what's currently supported by modern browsers, and what I'll discuss here. Here's an extremely simple [valid HTML5 webpage](http://validator.w3.org/check) (try a [demo](http://jsbin.com/figot/1/edit?html,output)):

````html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>This title shows up in a tab or window</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>This paragraph text will show up in your browser's viewport. Heck yes.</p>
	</body>
</html>
````

You might be wondering what in blazes "valid HTML5" is, and why you should care. Valid markup is going to be correctly understood by a browser, by a search engine bot like Google, or by a screenreader. If you want your content to get parsed correctly, in any context, you ought to be writing valid HTML. Thankfully, HTML is reasonably simple.

## The basics!

If any of this is ***too*** basic, feel free to move on. But it might be worth a refresher anyway. If nothing else, you can correct mistakes in this document, right?

### What the blazes is a tag?

A tag is surrounded by angle brackets, carets, less/greater-than-signs, whatever you want to call them. Alligators. Anyway, they generally *open* and *close*, which looks like this: `<html> foo </html>`. Notice how the second instance of the tag starts with a forward slash? That ends or *closes* the tag.

Tags and their contents are referred to as an *element*. Here's a paragraph element:

````html
<p>This paragraph, and its surrounding tags, is a single element</p>
````

To be valid code, tags must be *nested* properly. This means that the opening and closing tags of one element must lie within their **parent** element:

````html
<p>This paragraph is <strong>valid HTML</strong>, because the 'strong' tags lie within the 'p' tags.</p>

<p>This paragraph is <strong>invalid HTML</p></strong>, because it's nested improperly.
````

> **NOTE**: The best way to know that your code is going to work is to use a text editor or IDE that will syntax-highlight HTML. Some auto-complete or auto-close tags, which can be handy as well. I recommend [Sublime Text][sublimeintro], but it's your call.

Some tags are self-contained, and must not have contents; these **void elements** (such science fiction. wow.) are often marked up as "self-closing" tags, which end with a `/`; the image tag is the most typical example, and at its simplest looks like `<img />`. This example wouldn't actually *do* anything, but it's valid. Here's a more real-world example of an image tag:

````html
<img src="http://bukk.it/howimakeweb.gif" alt="How I make web (animated gif)" />
````

Notice how the tag has some key-value pairs, like `src` and `alt`? This brings us to:

### Attributes

That's right, attributes. HTML elements obtain their attributes from tags, and these can be used to provide the browser information about how they should look and behave.

3. attributes / data attrs

	````html
	<div id="unique" class="reusable multiple" style="">
		div			block html element. contains attributes:
			id		once per page. use sparingly.
			class	this is your swiss army knife. can reference multiple classes.
			style	defines an inline style. DO NOT USE.

		inline html elements:
			<span class="highlight">inline styling</span>
			<em>em</em>, not <i>italic</i>.
			<strong>strong</strong>, not <b>bold</b>.
	</div>
	````

4. semantic HTML
	* use the right thing in the right place
	* nesting of block vs inline elements
